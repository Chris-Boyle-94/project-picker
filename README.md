# project-picker

My idea is to use the public api repo (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) to pick an api to make something out of. I want to expand it past that but I don't have any ideas for that yet.

So far the ability to see a list of all APIs, pick a random one, or see a list by category are implemented.

I'm working on implementing a random feature but by category.
